          The word “photographer” tends to make people think of bad cell phone snapshots, posed family portraits, or artistic work displayed in museums. However, photography is a tool used by engineers and other specialists for scientific purposes.
          High resolution photos are used to record meteorological or geomagnetic patterns [1],
          by geologists to predict what kinds of rocks are on the moon [2],
          document eclipses or other astronomical events [1],
          as well as for other scientific uses [1].
          In the case of space exploration, photography is perhaps best known for picking landing sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          On July 16th, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin (pictured, left to right) launched from the Kennedy Space Center (pictured below). The Saturn V rocket took the crew of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, where they were
          planning on landing near the equator so they
          would not need to change the orbital plane and could save fuel, but the specific landing site they picked was the result of years of study and discussion [2]. To be considered, landing sites needed to be smooth and flat. The approach path
          needed to be short, could not have hills, cliffs, or craters, and the sun needed to be behind the lunar module as they landed [3]. The scientific value of any of these sites was not considered, and even then NASA has to relax the
          requirement for prospective sites being crater free. A year and half before the mission, NASA had narrowed their list down to five sites thanks to seven robotic spacecraft, five uncrewed probes that had been sent to the surface of the moon,
          and the Apollo 10 mission [3] (pictured). The second site was eventually selected (close up pictured) [3].

          Thirteen missions might seem a bit excessive, but the telescopes available on earth were not able to provide the detail that was needed to determine if a site might be a safe landing site [3]. Photography in space is complicated now, but in
          the 1960s, there were no digital cameras. On an unmanned mission, there are no people to change film, adjust settings, or realize that the automatic settings could be incorrect (for example, when taking pictures of white beaches or white
          snow, automatic cameras often guess that the picture should be less white than it should be, and the auto-generated settings make the photographs too dark). For example, in 1966 the Lunar Orbiter 1 was supposed to photograph possible Apollo
          landing sites, but the 610mm zoom lens and the velocity-to-height sensor (v/h sensor)
          were not properly synchronized. The mission had to be dramatically changed because there would have been no point in descending while the camera was not functioning [4]. In 1967, during the Lunar Orbiter 4 the thermal door closed while it was taking photographs. The flight controllers struggled to prevent the camera lens from fogging and light leaks to destroy the film. Engineers managed to
          work around the issues they faced, and that mission is now considered to be the most successful of the Orbiter missions [4].
        </p>
        <p>
          Missions to Mars have faced similar issues because they are unmanned. However, there have also been many success stories. On July 14th, 1965, Mariner 4 flew past Mars and provided the first close up photographs (below, black and white
          photos) of
          Mars. In 1976 and 1977 the Viking 1 and Viking 2 took the first color photos (below, color photos) [5]. These photos shaped early impressions of Mars: dry deserts, with no signs of water or life [6].

          Missions since then have done further research into the climate and other factors that will be essential for planning a safe and successful
          mission. The Mars Global Surveyor Mission (1997-2006) was responsible for mapping Mars, and the resulting photographs and 3D models are still used today [7]. The mission was designed to research the climate and geology of Mars, determine if
          there ever was life on Mars, and prepare for human exploration on Mars. Photographs were key tools for scientists to work towards each of these four main goals. The wind and ice conditions on the surface were monitored. Craters (pictured)
          and lava
          flows (pictured) were discovered, as well as gullies (pictured) that were formed from liquid water, and a delta (pictured) that may have been formed by a life with microbal life [8]. Potential landing sites for the 2011 Curiosity rover and
          other missions were photographed
          [8].

          There is much more that we can learn from Mars, and as photographic techniques continue to be developed, scientists continue to find new uses for photography to further research in space. While we aren't likely to be using cell phone
          snapshots or portraits taken in space, many other kinds of photography will certainly be used for many decades to come.
